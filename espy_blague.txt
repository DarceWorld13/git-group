So let's get this show on the road.
Unfortunatedly i don't know that mush jokes in english on the fly so this migh switch to franch in the middle.
I'll try to give a warning though.

Starting with basics : 
Q : Why don't skeleton dance?
A : Because they have nobody (no body)
(ta-da-tchin)

This one specifically for you Thibault.For the others, i'm sorry...
Jocaste : Oedipe...
Oedipe : I'm coming
Jocaste : So soon?
PS : if you don't understand it, don't try to, its better that way, trust me...
